* Goals (by priority) :
    - edition commands should be as fast, or faster (as in less keystroke) than vi
    - consistency
    - ability tu run background tasks, for exemple :vimgrep equivalent should run while displaying results
    - syntax highlighting
    - completion framework
    - inotify support

* Non goals :
    - No window management, this should be handled by a window manager or screen/tmux,
      but the editor should accept multiple heads
