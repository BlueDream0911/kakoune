High Priority

Medium Priority
---------------

* tweak editing model, some behaviours are not intuitive, maybe a line
  wise mode will be needed after all.

* encoding: support different encoding for files, make utf8 implementation
  more robust

* key binding support

* configurable insert mode completion support

* pasting big chunks of text from the terminal is slooooow as well
  optimize that.

* hierarchical highlighter/filter groups.
