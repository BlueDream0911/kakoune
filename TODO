* encoding: support different encoding for files, make utf8 implementation
  more robust

* support multi column chars

* right-to-left, bidirectional text

* key binding support

* Mouse support

* Crash recovery support (swap files)

* Sanitize prompt history handling, hooks should not have side effects
  on history

* More text objects: indent, user defined ?

* automatic line splitting

* folding support

* spelling support

* improve info boxes, use a sane hiding behaviour

* allow colalias to reference another colalias

* investigate 'kakdiff'

* improve input filters, try to have a decent C++ input mode indenter

* Tree based undo

* incrementation/decrementation of integers support

* more sane command line parsing, better shell interaction with quoting

* configurable evaluated (%sh{...}) strings ? use an option to define
  the interpreters, regex for finding used kak variables (ability to
  add direct python/perl/ruby/whatever evaluation).
