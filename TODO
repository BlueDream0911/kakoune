* encoding: support different encoding for files, make utf8 implementation
  more robust

* support multi column chars

* right-to-left, bidirectional text

* key binding support

* Mouse support

* Crash recovery support (swap files)

* Sanitize prompt history handling, hooks should not have side effects
  on history

* More text objects: indent, user defined ?

* automatic line splitting

* folding support

* spelling support

* improve info boxes, use a sane hiding behaviour

* allow colalias to reference another colalias

* investigate 'kakdiff'

* improve input filters, try to have a decent C++ input mode indenter

* Tree based undo

* incrementation/decrementation of integers support

* more sane command line parsing, better shell interaction with quoting

* configurable evaluated (%sh{...}) strings ? use an option to define
  the interpreters, regex for finding used kak variables (ability to
  add direct python/perl/ruby/whatever evaluation).

* tab support for indentation

* %rec{...%opt{tchou}...%sh{echo kanaky}} ~= "...${kak_opt_tchou}...$(echo kanaky)..."

* Optimize BufferModificationListener behaviour:
  - Editor should modify in reverse order, as a modification at one point does not
    impact the position of selections before it, so applying modification in reverse
    order removes the needs to have selection updated on the fly, and permit deferred
    update.
  - Accumulate all the modifications and update the selections with the
    whole knowledge -> try to remove this O(n2) behaviour.
