* tweak editing model, some behaviours are not intuitive, fix append when
  end of line is selected (maybe we can merge some code between editor and
  IncrementalInserter. By the way, IncrementalInserter is now only used by
  InputHandler's InputMode::Insert, maybe this could be refactored).

* encoding: support different encoding for files, make utf8 implementation
  more robust

* key binding support

* configurable insert mode completion support

* pasting big chunks of text from the terminal is slooooow.
  (this is due to WordCompletion regex matching the whole
   buffer once per inserted char)

* support an -e 'command' command line option, working with newly
  connecting clients (so that they can specify the file to edit,
  specify the client name...)

* Add tooltip support to ui, and a command to display info

* Add support for specifying command to run when selecting
  a menu item (without validation). Use case include using
  the tooltip functionality to display additional
  informations

* Design an Asynchronous model for interaction with external tools.
  For example Kakoune should provide a way to run a completion
  shell command without freezing until the completer returns.
