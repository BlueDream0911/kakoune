Vi(m) to Kakoune:
=================

Most operations in Kakoune are reversed compared to Vim: In kak, you first
select the text you want to act on, then you edit it. This way, things are
much more consistent, as for example, kak does not need a key for delete
character, the delete key handles this just fine as long as you did not
select more than a character (but clearing selection is only one space away).

delete a word:
 * vim: dw
 * kak: wd

delete a character:
 * vim: x
 * kak: d or <space>d

copy a line:
 * vim: yy
 * kak: xy

global replace:
 * vim: :%s/word/replacement<ret>
 * kak: %sword<ret>creplacement<esc>

join line with next:
 * vim: J
 * kak: alt-J

delete to line end:
 * vim: d$
 * kak: alt-ld or gld
